# tamagotchi

## Todo
* adding a function to decrease the health

## Possible things to add
Some interesting things I could add to the
tamagotchi programme which shouldn't be too hard:

* sleeping with all values with over 50% full heals the pet if it has lost health
* add pooping and cleaning function
* let it get sick if it's health is low, by random chance or if there's too much poop
* add sleep function, you have to switch the lights off otherwise it will have nightmare and loose one health point.
* add the possibility to get sick. Maybe compare two random numbers.
* add a function to restart the game or exit it after the pet died.
* add a function let the user exit the game
* safe the stats in a text file
* make a separate function for each age because it makes the aging
function more readable
* add a function which lets the tamagotchi age (one week as a youngling, three weeks as an adult and two weeks as an elderly)
